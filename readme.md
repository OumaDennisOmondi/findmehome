# FindMeHome Open Source Laravel Project

FindMeHome is an open source Project. 

Find rooms where ever you go, anytime, at any cost.

All we wish is to make life easier for people who want to share their space and for people who are new to the state and want a place to stay. We connect an owner to the tenant and vice versa.

Laravel Framework is used to build FindMeHome

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable, creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel attempts to take the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in the majority of web projects, such as authentication, routing, sessions, queueing, and caching.

## Official Documentation

Documentation for the framework can be found on the [Laravel website](http://laravel.com/docs).
